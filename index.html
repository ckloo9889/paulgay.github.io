	cbmi_abstract:' <a href="http://publications.idiap.ch/downloads/papers/2014/Gay_CBMI_2014.pdf">pdf</a> <br>  Paul Gay, Gregor Dupuy, Jean-Marc Odobez, Meignier Sylvain and Paul Deleglise <p> We address the task of identifying people appearing in TV shows. The target persons are all people whose identity is said or written, like the journalists and the well known people, as politicians, athletes, celebrities, etc. In our approach, overlaid names displayed on the images are used to identify the persons without any use of biometric models for the speakers and the faces. Two identification methods are evaluated as part of the REPERE French evaluation campaign. The first one relies on co-occurrence times between overlay person names and speaker/face clusters, and rule-based decisions which assign a name to each monomodal cluster. The second method uses a Conditionnal Random Field (CRF) which combine different types of co-occurrence statistics and pair-wised constraints to jointly identify speakers and faces.</p>',
	icip_abstract:' <a href="http://publications.idiap.ch/downloads/papers/2015/Gay_ICIP_2014.pdf">pdf</a> <br> Paul Gay, Elie Khoury, Sylvain Meignier, Jean-Marc Odobez, and Paul Deleglise <p>We investigate the problem of face identification in broadcast programs where people names are obtained from text overlays automatically processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and further linked to the faces throughout the video.  To solve the face-name association and propagation, we propose a novel approach that combines the positive effects of two Conditional Random Field (CRF) models: a CRF for person diarization (joint temporal segmentation and association of voices and faces) that benefit from the combination of multiple cues including as main contributions the use of identification sources (OCR appearances) and recurrent local face visual background (LFB) playing the role of a namedness feature; a second CRF for the joint identification of the person clusters that improves identification performance thanks to the use of further diarization statistics.  Experiments conducted on a recent and substantial public dataset of 7 different shows  demonstrate  the  interest  and  complementarity  of  the different modeling steps and information sources, leading to state of the art result </p>',

	icassp_abstract:' <a href="http://publications.idiap.ch/downloads/papers/2014/Gay_ICASSP_2014.pdf">pdf</a> <br> Paul Gay, Elie Khoury, Sylvain Meignier, Jean-Marc Odobez, and Paul Deleglise <p>We investigate the problem of audio-visual (AV) person diarization in broadcast data.  That is, automatically associate the faces and voices of people and determine when they appear or speak in the video.  The contributions are twofolds. First, we formulate the problem within a novel CRF framework  that  simultaneously  performs  the  AV  association of voices and face clusters to build AV person models, and the joint  segmentation  of  the  audio  and  visual  streams  using  a set of AV cues and their association strength.  Secondly, we use for this AV association strength a score that does not only rely on lips activity,  but also on contextual visual information (face size, position, number of detected faces,...)  that leads to more reliable association measures.  Experiments on 6  hours  of  broadcast  data  show  that  our  framework  is  able to improve the AV-person diarization especially for speaker segments erroneously labeled in the mono-modal case.</p>',

To achieve this face-track clustering task, we propose a hierarchical approach combining the strength of two complementary measures:  (i) a pairwise matching similarity relying on local interest points allowing the accurate clustering of faces tracks captured in similar conditions, a situation typically found in temporally close shots of broadcast videos or in talk-shows</p>',

The proposed scheme relied on the  application  of  the  Bags-of-Features  (BoF)  approach  to  acoustic  echograms.  This approach  is  widely  exploited  for  pattern  recognition  issues  and  naturally  applies here, considering  fish  schools  as  the  relevant  elementary  objects.  It  relies  on the  extraction  and categorization  of  fish  schools  in  fisheries  acoustic  data.  Echogram  descriptors  were computed  per  unit  echogram  length  as  the  numbers  of  schools,  in  different  school categories.  We  applied  this  approach  to  the  discrimination  of  juvenile  and  adult  anchovy (Engraulis  ringens)  off  Peru.  Whereas  the  discrimination  of  individual  schools  is  low (below  70%),  the  proposed  BoF  scheme  achieved  between  89%  and  92%  of  correct classification of juvenile and adult echograms for different survey datasets and significantly outperformed classical school-based echogram characteristics (about 10% of improvement of the correct classification rate). We further illustrate the potential of the proposed scheme for the estimation of the spatial distribution of juvenile and adult anchovy populations. /<p>',

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <a name="biblio"> </a>
        I graduated in computer sciences from <a href="http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/">INSA Rouen</a> (France) in 2011 and obtained at the same time a M. of Sciences from university of Rouen.
        <br> 
        Then, I started a phd under the supervision of Sylvain Meigner (<a href="www-lium.univ-lemans.fr">LIUM</a>, France) and Jean Marc Odobez (<a href="http://www.idiap.ch/">IDIAP Research Institute</a>, Switzerland). 
        My research there focused on investigating algorithms for unsupervised Audio-visual person identification in broadcast data. 
        The major part of this work consisted in improving speaker diarization and face clustering systems. 
        I used probabilistic graphical models to integrate the different modalities in a global framework.  
	This work took place in the context of the <a href="http://www.defi-repere.fr/">REPERE evaluation campaign</a>.
        <br>
        During the school year 2014-2015, I was a teaching assistant (ATER) at Avignon university and member of the <a target="_blank" href="http://lia.univ-avignon.fr/">LIA</a> lab. 
	<br>
	I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at PAVIS/IIT (Genova Italia) where I work on probabistic matrix factorization, with an application on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7ierVkXYa8">structure from motion</a> and motion segmentation.
